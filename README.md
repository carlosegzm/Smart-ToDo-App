![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

**T√î DOido** is a Java desktop application for managing personal and group tasks, built with a clean and responsive graphical user interface using Swing.

The name **"T√î DOido"** is a creative play on words in Portuguese:  
It reflects how we often feel overwhelmed when we have too many tasks to handle (literal translation: *"I'm going crazy"*) ‚Äî while also cleverly embedding "**TO DO**" in uppercase within the name, referencing a traditional **to-do list** application. The dual meaning blends humor and utility, making the app memorable and relevant.
